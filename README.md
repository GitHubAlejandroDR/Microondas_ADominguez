# Modeling, Implementation and Testing a Microwave System | Java | Patterns Design | JUNIT | CUCUMBER

## Description

In this project, modeling, implementation and testing of a microwave system is provided. 

Specific task performed:

- Define the most appropiate pattern desig for modelling components and relations between them in a microwave system.

- Implementation of microwave components and functionalities

- Designing and performing JUNIT tests for the different microwave states. Specifically, changes in variables and methods according to microwave state are tested.

- Designing and performing CUCUMBER tests for the different microwave states. Specifically, changes in variables and methods according to microwave state are tested.

## Technologies

- Java
- JUNIT
- Cucumber
